# Verdant Emerald

A fork of [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) that breathes extra life into Pokémon Emerald. With new ways to adventure through the game: alternate paths on existing routes, brand new areas with the same Hoenn feel, and newer Pokémon -never before seen in the region, including events for all new legendaries.

These docs serve to provide information all the added features and changes. I am constantly expanding this site, so hopefully you will be able to find everything you need to know about Verdant Emerald here.
