## Balance Changes

All Pokémon have been balanced to bring up the preformance of weaker mons. Nerfs have been avoided as much as possible as not to change the aspects you like about your favourite Pokémon.

The goal of all balance changes is to make all Pokémon fun to use in one way or another. Often by granting them tools they wouldn't have had prior. In terms of strength, both Smogon and the predicted landscape of Verdant Emerald were considered.

While some Pokémon may remain weak, they should present enough of a niche to be useable over alternatives if you want to do so, and all should function just fine in a casual playthrough.

The following aspects of Pokémon have been changed:

- Stats
- Abilities
- Learnsets
- Types (sparingly)

Pokémon have not been given new forms (such as Megas) or gimmicks (such as Items). Although existing ones have been balanced.

There are no custom Moves or Abilities added. All Move and Ability changes are selected from Vanilla Gen 1-8.

:::notice

A version of the patch without Pokémon balance changes is available on the releases page.

## Trainer Changes

Trainers have been made slightly more intellegent in general, and become far more intellegent as you progress.

In addition to Wild Pokémon throughout the region being changed to include Pokémon from Gens 1-8, Trainers have been given new partners to reflect the expanded Pokédex, and the level curve adjusted slightly.

The philosophy for Trainer changes is to add extra interest to standard trainers, rather than making every trainer incredibly powerful. Some scaling changes have been made, but in general the default experience is made to appeal to casual players.

Significant trainers such as Gym leaders, Elite Four, your Rival, and Magma/Aqua should feel stronger than vanilla but still easy enough for a casual player.

All Trainer party changes are designed in a way they should make sense in the context of the new region.

A version of the patch with Vanilla Trainer parties is available on the releases page.

## Level Caps

Accompanying increased Exp Gains for Trainer battles, and Exp Gains for catching wild Pokémon, you have the option of two level caps:

### Soft Level Caps (Default)

Soft Level Caps reduce your Exp curve as you meet and subsiquently begin to surpass the level of the next Significant Trainer's Ace Pokémon. The reduction begins slow but ramps up as you outscale the Trainer's Ace. Eventually Exp stops.

The goal of Soft Level Caps is to keep you within reasonable range of your next challenge, prevent you from overscaling, but allow you to outmatch your opponent slightly if you spend the time necessary to grind.

The game experience has been designed around the use of Soft Level Caps so they are enabled by default, but can be disabled in any PokéCenter by speaking to the Battle Master.

### Hard Level Caps

Hard Level Caps act as an increased difficulty mode for people who like a challenge. Hard Caps provide the most 'honourable' experience, as they cut off Exp entirely as soon as your reach the level of the next Significant Trainer's Ace Pokémon.

Hard Level Caps do not have an Exp reduction curve. They go from 100% to 0% immediately.

:::notice

An Infinite Rare Candy can be aquired early in the game to skip grinding. Exp caps will prevent you from over levelling when using this Rare Candy, so go wild.

## Challenge Mode

Challenge Mode is available in-game. Enable Challenge Mode by putting the Challenge Card in your Bag before you leave the starting Truck.

In Challenge Mode, the following rules are enforced:

- Hard Level Caps are on.
- Battle Style is Set.
- All Trainers have much more Intelligent AI (Equivalent to end-game Gym Trainers, except where already smarter).

Brave Challenge Mode and recieve a special cosmetic reward at the end of the game.

## In-Built Randomiser

Interact with your Diary in your room to customise your gameplay experience with Randomisation.

The following features can be randomised by individual toggles:

- Wild Encounters
- Pokémon Abilities
- Trainer Parties

Pokémon that have already been caught are not effected by the Wild Encounter randomisation.

### Randomiser Seed

You can also view your Randomiser Seed in your Diary, as well as change the active Seed at any time.

By doing so, you can use the same Seed as a friend to play with the same Random Encounters/Abilities/Trainers (if toggled on), or set challenges for a community with difficult seeds, etc.

:::notice

Setting a custom seed will invalidate a Challenge Mode run, preventing you from unlocking the special reward at the end of the game.
