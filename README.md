# Verdant-Emerald Base
*The Pokeemerald base with Verdant Emerald changes*

A fork of pret/pokeemerald that breathes extra life into Pokemon Emerald. With new ways to adventure through the game: alternate paths on existing routes, brand new areas with the same Hoenn feel, and newer Pokemon never before seen in the region, including events for all new legendaries.
